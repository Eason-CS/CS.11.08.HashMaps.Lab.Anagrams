Implement **three** methods:

1) **HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> anagrams(String filename)**
  Given a **text file** containing English words, build a **hashmap** that holds lists of words that are anagrams.
2) **ArrayList<String> mostFrequentAnagram(HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> anagrams)**
  Given a **hashmap** that holds lists of words that are anagrams, return the **list that has the most words** (the list that contains the most amount of anagrams).
3) **void printKeyValuePairs(HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> anagrams)**
  Given a **hashmap** that holds lists of words that are anagrams, **output all of the key value pairs**.
